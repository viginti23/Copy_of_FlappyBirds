import pygame

# check for collisions between rects
# use rects if collision events are expected

# we can use different points on rect to put in on the screen

# creating rects

# surface.get_rect(rect_position)
# use that to put the rect around the given surface
# this way the rect gets the same dimensions as the surface
# also we are giving the surface the ability to check for collisions
# we can also rotate the surface around any point on the rect

# rects also have other points of reference (top, bottom, left, right, centerx, centery)
# we can use them to move the rect

# surfaces don't allow to control collision, rotation and responding to keys
